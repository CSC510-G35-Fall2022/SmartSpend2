### <u>Additions:</u>
- Fixed several bugs related to parsing and tracking.
- Updated menu view to display slash commands when "/" is typed in telegram chat
- - <img src="https://github.com/CSC510-G35-Fall2022/SmartSpend2/blob/main/images/updated_menu.png" alt="commands" width="500"/>
- Refactored old code to suit updated structure.
- - Previously all of the code was in a single file with around 650 lines. This appeared messy and was hard to edit parts of the program.
- - Attempted one refactor method which can be seen in [this branch](https://github.com/CSC510-G35-Fall2022/SmartSpend2/tree/refactor). This method was too time consuming and required more of the codebase to be refactored.
- - Tried another refactor method, much faster, worked simpler, did not need to update more of the code base. This has been merged to main.
- Moved away from Travis to GitHub actions for rolling builds.
- Also added cancel feature, to abort an 'add' transaction at any point.
- <u>Feature</u> -> Add 'limit_category' feature to work as an alarm when spending exceed preset limits.
- - Users can create limits on the existing categories, food, groceries, utilities, ...
